## What seems to work

<font size = "5" color = "DarkBlue">

- Intentional
    - Passionate advocates
    - Coordinators
    - Having R and R Studio on the estate
    - Structured sessions and program
    - Mailbox comms and updates (with distribution list)
    
<br>

- Less intentional but important!
    - Good senior management support
    - Lync conversations and presenting

</font>

<div class="footer"></div>

## Challenges

- IM, a long time to get R and R Studio on the network

- Retaining consistent numbers for the RUG and ISLR sessions

- RUG responsible for user testing new version of R for roll out

- Day jobs!

- Volunteers...

## Future plans

- Youtube demos

- A broader data science focus

- Introduce more external/guest speakers

- Advertise more widely with more taster sessions.
